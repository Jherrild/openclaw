### COFFEE STATUS MONITOR
1. Read the website https://coffee.herrild.net.
2. Check the date on the page to see if it refers to the **upcoming Sunday**.
3. If the date is in the past, or if it does not clearly reflect the status for this coming Sunday:
   - Notify Jesten in the main chat.
   - Ask him: "Are you hosting coffee this Sunday?"
   - Remind him to update the website to reflect the correct status.
4. If the website is already updated for the upcoming Sunday, reply NO_REPLY.
