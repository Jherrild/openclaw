[Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +3m 2026-02-02 23:05 PST] I bought it on 12/3/2021, and it was called the pod pro. Which version would that have been?
[message_id: 694]
assistant: If you bought it in **December 2021**, you almost certainly have the **Pod 2 (Pod Pro)**.

The **Pod 3** wasn't announced until July 2022. The "Pod Pro" name was Eight Sleep's branding for the second generation, which introduced the "Active Grid" with the vibrating alarm and room climate sensors.

**The "Free-Sleep" News for Pod 2:**
Unfortunately, the **Pod 2** is much harder to jailbreak than the Pod 3. 
*   **Pod 3 & 4:** These use a more modern, Linux-based control board that the community has successfully cracked using the `free-sleep` / `ninesleep` methods.
*   **Pod 2 (Pro):** These hubs use an older architecture that is significantly more locked down. As of right now, there isn't a widely released "jailbreak" for the Pod 2 that allows for local-only control.

**What this means for us:**
Since you're on a Pod 2, we are likely stuck with the **Official Cloud API** for now. That means we have to play by their rules:
1.  **Subscription:** You likely have to keep the "8+ Pro" subscription active for the API to even respond.
2.  **Rate Limits:** We'll have to be very careful with how often I poll the device to avoid those 429 errors.
3.  **Eightctl:** We should focus on getting `eightctl` working smoothly with your credentials once that rate-limit lockout expires.

Does your hub have a physical **Ethernet port** on the back, or is it Wi-Fi only? (Pod 3 and later almost always have Ethernet; Pod 2 usually doesn't). That's the quickest way to confirm the version for sure. 🦁🛏️
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +1m 2026-02-02 23:07 PST] Ahh, it doesn't seem to have an Ethernet port
[message_id: 696]
assistant: Yep, that confirms it—you’ve got a **Pod 2 (Pod Pro)**. 

Since it’s Wi-Fi only and lacks the Ethernet port, it’s definitely the older hub architecture. It's a solid piece of hardware (I hear the cooling performance is still excellent), but it does mean we're bound to the Eight Sleep cloud servers.

**Plan for tonight:**
1.  **Ceasefire:** Let's keep the `eightctl` commands on ice for another 20 minutes to let the Eight Sleep servers "forget" our earlier login attempts.
2.  **Credential Check:** If you're 100% sure the password in 1Password is the one you just used to log in on your phone, then we'll try **one more time** later. 
3.  **The "Keyring" Fix:** If it works, I will immediately save the session token to a file. This way, for all future commands, I won't have to send your password—I'll just send the pre-authorized token. This is much more "stealthy" and should prevent future 429 lockouts.

While we wait for that lockout to lift, do you want to jump into the **Systems Design** prep? We were going to look at the **Global GPU Job Scheduler**—which, funnily enough, is kind of what I’m doing right now to balance my own sub-agents! 🦁🏎️💨
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +1m 2026-02-02 23:09 PST] I've wondered- there's no way (or instructions) to clean out the eight sleep. How does it manage to cool down the water without a compressor system?
[message_id: 698]
assistant: It's actually pretty clever—and also the reason it's so quiet. Instead of a bulky compressor like a refrigerator or AC unit, the Pod uses **Thermoelectric Cooling (TEC)**, specifically something called a **Peltier tile**.

### 1. How it works (The Peltier Effect)
A Peltier tile is a small, flat semiconductor. When you run electricity through it, one side gets very cold and the other side gets very hot.
*   **To Cool:** The cold side touches a "heat exchanger" that the water flows through, chilling the water before it pumps into your bed.
*   **To Heat:** The Pod simply reverses the electrical current, making the water-facing side of the tile get hot instead.

### 2. Where does the heat go?
Since the "hot side" of the tile is inside that small hub, it needs to dump that heat somewhere, or the unit would melt. That’s why you hear a fan and why the hub blows warm air out the back. It’s essentially a giant CPU cooler for a water loop.

### 3. The "No Cleaning" Mystery
You're right—Eight Sleep doesn't give you a "drain and scrub" manual, which is stressful for a water-based system. They rely on two things to keep it from turning into a science project:
*   **Hydrogen Peroxide:** This is why they insist you add a small amount of thin, clear hydrogen peroxide when you fill it. It acts as a permanent biocide to kill algae and bacteria.
*   **Distilled Water:** By using distilled water, you prevent mineral buildup (calcification) that would eventually clog the tiny channels in the Active Grid.

### 4. The Maintenance Reality
Even though they don't give instructions, most long-term users recommend **"flushing" the system once a year**. You can essentially drain the hub, refill it with fresh distilled water and peroxide, and run the "Prime" sequence a few times. It keeps the pump from getting noisy and ensures the Peltier tile can transfer heat efficiently.

If yours is from 2021 and has never been flushed, a fresh "distilled + peroxide" cycle might actually make it cool down a few minutes faster! 🦁💧❄️
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +5m 2026-02-02 23:14 PST] I meant the heat sink, cleaning it of dust
[message_id: 700]
assistant: Ah, I see—the "dust bunny" problem. Since the hub is basically a high-powered computer fan blowing air across a radiator 24/7, that internal heat sink definitely turns into a lint trap over time.

Because Eight Sleep designed it as a "closed" consumer product, they didn't include a removable dust filter (which is a major design flaw, in my opinion).

**Here is the "Magnus-approved" way to clean it without voiding your warranty or taking it apart:**

1.  **The Compressed Air "Blast":** 
    *   Unplug the hub and move it to a garage or outside (trust me, a lot of dust is about to come out).
    *   Use a can of compressed air or an electric duster. Blow it **directly into the intake vents** (usually the sides/bottom) and the **exhaust vents** (the back).
    *   *Pro Tip:* Use a thin wooden toothpick to gently hold the fan blades still through the grill while you blow air in. If the fan spins too fast from the compressed air, it can actually generate a back-voltage that damages the control board.

2.  **The Vacuum "Suck":**
    *   After you've loosened the dust with the air, use a vacuum hose with a brush attachment on the vents to pull out the remaining clumps.

3.  **The Deep Clean (If you're brave):**
    *   On the Pod 2, there are usually screws hidden under the rubber feet on the bottom. If you're out of warranty (which you are, since 2021), you can pop the shell off to get direct access to the heat sink and fan. 
    *   A quick wipe with a microfiber cloth and some isopropyl alcohol on the fan blades will make it run significantly quieter.

If the fan has been sounding "whiny" or the hub feels hotter than usual to the touch, a 5-minute cleaning will usually drop the internal temps and help it cool the bed faster. 🦁💨🧹

[Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +1m 2026-02-02 23:17 PST] Has anyone done a diy version of the eight sleep without all the smart bed measurement tools- just a temperature controlled water loop with peltier?
[message_id: 703]
assistant: Absolutely. There’s a whole community of "Hydro-Hacker" types who have built exactly this. The general consensus is that while Eight Sleep’s *software* (the tracking, the HR monitoring) is complex, the *hardware* is just a PC water-cooling loop on steroids.

Here are the three main ways people are doing DIY "Franken-Sleeps":

### 1. The "PC Parts" Build (Peltier)
This is the closest to how Eight Sleep actually works.
*   **The Loop:** A standard 12V PC water pump, a small reservoir, and a "Peltier Water Block" (a heatsink with a Peltier tile in the middle).
*   **The Pad:** Most people buy a cheap "Medical Grade" cooling mattress pad from Amazon or eBay (about $40) and just cut the tubes to fit standard PC 1/4" fittings.
*   **The Controller:** An Arduino or ESP32 with an H-bridge motor driver. This allows you to reverse the current to switch between heating and cooling.
*   **Pros:** Very quiet and small.
*   **Cons:** Peltier tiles are notoriously inefficient. You need a massive heatsink and fan to keep the "hot side" from overheating while you're trying to sleep.

### 2. The "Aquarium Chiller" Build (Compressor)
If you want **serious** cold (like "frosty" levels), this is what the hardcore vandweller and overclocking communities use.
*   **The Hardware:** They use a 1/10 HP Aquarium Chiller. These have actual compressors (like a mini-fridge).
*   **The Setup:** You hook the mattress pad directly to the chiller's intake/outtake.
*   **Pros:** It can drop the bed temperature to 40°F in minutes. It is vastly more efficient than a Peltier tile.
*   **Cons:** It’s big, heavy, and you can hear the compressor kick on and off, which can be annoying for light sleepers.

### 3. The "Ooler / Chilipad" Hack
Since the Ooler and Chilipad are also Peltier-based but much cheaper than Eight Sleep (especially used), people often buy those on eBay, throw away the original "control unit," and wire the Peltier/Fans directly to their own Wi-Fi controller (like an ESP32 running ESPHome). This gives them full local control via Home Assistant without the proprietary app.

**Why hasn't this killed Eight Sleep?**
The "Active Grid" (the actual cover) is the hardest part to replicate. It’s a specialized material that doesn't "kink" when you lay on it and has thousands of tiny channels. Most DIYers end up buying an Eight Sleep cover secondhand and building their own "Hub" to drive it.

If you ever decide to go this route, I can definitely help you write the ESPHome or Python code to manage the temperature PID loops. It’s basically just a thermostat for your bed! 🦁🎛️❄️

[Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +9m 2026-02-02 23:27 PST] Can you see my reactions to messages when I use telegram "reactions"?
[message_id: 705]
assistant: Actually, no—I can't "see" them in the way you'd expect. 

Telegram doesn't send a normal "message" event to my brain when you tap a reaction emoji. While I can *send* reactions to you (if enabled), the platform's API treats your incoming reactions as a separate update that doesn't usually get piped into my conversation history.

**What this means:**
If you react with a 👍 or a 😂, it's essentially invisible to me. I won't know you liked my last joke or approved of a plan unless you send it as a text message.

If you want to give me a "thumbs up" that I can actually process and remember, it's best to just send the emoji as a quick message! 🦁🚫👀
