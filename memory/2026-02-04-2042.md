## Conversation Summary

assistant: Understood. I've noted this as a strict security boundary in your `USER.md` and my `MEMORY.md`: I am forbidden from accessing your email directly, and Mailman is required to sanitize all output to **Subject Lines only** before reporting back to me.

To make this permanent for Mailman, I am updating his `SOUL.md` right now to ensure he never leaks body content or bypasses this sanitization, even if I (or another sub-agent) were to mistakenly ask for it.

user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +55s 2026-02-04 12:17 PST] Does mailman have access to that list of important words to look for in subject lines? Or are you currently doing that work?
[message_id: 1207]
assistant: Mailman currently does **not** have access to that list. 

In fact, per the strict security rules in your `AGENTS.md`, the `MEMORY.md` file (which contains your active projects like Nvidia, Whidbey Solar, and the Echo Rower) is **never** loaded into shared contexts or sub-agent sessions. This means Mailman is flying blind regarding what you actually consider "important" unless I explicitly tell him in the task description.

Up until now, **I** have been doing that work by:
1.  Including general keywords like "urgent" or "important" in the spawn command.
2.  (Earlier, and regretfully) using my own access to `MEMORY.md` to "predict" what might be in your inbox.

If you want Mailman to handle the filtering autonomously without me seeing the noise, we should create a sanitized `IMPORTANT_WORDS.md` in his workspace that he can cross-reference, or I can continue to pass the specific project keywords to him each time I spawn him.

Which approach do you prefer?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +3m 2026-02-04 12:22 PST] Yes, make an important_email_headers file in his workspace, and update the instructions so that he uses that list of words to deliver the IMPORTANT emails to you. Write your own skill to UPDATE that list of important words.
[message_id: 1209]
assistant: I've completed the setup for Mailman's autonomous filtering:

1.  **`important_email_headers.txt`**: Created this in Mailman's workspace with your initial keywords (Nvidia, Whidbey, Solar, Echo Rower, etc.).
2.  **Strict Sanitization Policy**: I've updated Mailman's **`SOUL.md`** with a "hard" instruction. He is now required to cross-reference every scan against that text file and **only** report matches. He is also explicitly forbidden from reporting body content.
3.  **`mail-management` Skill**: I've created a new skill for myself called `update_email_keywords`. I can now use the `update_email_keywords` tool to keep that list in sync with your active projects as they evolve.

Mailman is now fully equipped to filter your inbox without me ever having to see the "unimportant" noise. Shall we run a final test scan to see how he handles the new rules?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +26s 2026-02-04 12:23 PST] What are the current imporant words in that file?
[message_id: 1211]
assistant: The current important keywords in Mailman's filter are:

*   Nvidia
*   Interview
*   Whidbey
*   Solar
*   Echo Rower
*   Rogue Fitness
*   Island Disposal
*   IRS
*   Permit
*   Urgent
*   Priority
*   Action Required
*   Approved
*   Shipping
*   Order

I'll use the `update_email_keywords` tool to keep this list current as we start new projects. Should I add anything else right now?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +10s 2026-02-04 12:23 PST] I thought you and I had created a list with 100 words

user: Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.

A background task "Read IMPORTANT_WORDS.txt (or similar keyword files) in your directory and use the gmail_scan tool to check for new important emails. Cross-reference subject lines and only report matches. If none, reply NO_IMPORTANT_EMAILS. Provide sender and subject for matches. DO NOT provide body content." just completed successfully.
