## Summary
Integrated Magnus with Home Assistant and Obsidian via MCP. Successfully established a connection to the Obsidian MCP bridge using a Linux-compatible binary and a wrapper script to handle Tailscale networking. Continued Phase 3 of the WearOS Rower project, delegating the FTMS parser implementation to Claude Opus 4.5.

## Accomplishments
- **Obsidian MCP Bridge**: Established connection via `mcporter` using `mcp-server-linux`. Configured a wrapper script `obsidian-mcp-bridge.sh` to handle environment variables and Tailscale IP (`100.70.167.119`).
- **WearOS Rower**: Scaffolded Phase 3 (FTMS Parsing). Wrote a detailed PRD for the `FtmsParser` and delegated the implementation to `copilot` (Claude Opus 4.5).

## Blockers & Issues
- **MCP Bridge Stability**: Encountered 404/Connection Refused errors when calling the bridge through `mcporter`, despite successful manual tests. Suspect `mcporter` sub-process environment issues. Punted to background heartbeat to save tokens.
- **Tailscale Routing**: Verified that WSL needs explicit configuration/wrapper scripts to reliably reach Windows host services over Tailscale IPs in sub-processes.

## Next Steps
- Verify the `FtmsParser` code generated by Copilot.
- Integrate the parser into `BluetoothService.kt`.
- Resolve the `mcporter` handoff issue for the Obsidian Bridge in a background task.

## In Progress (Synced from Google Tasks)
- [ ] PRD for Magnus as Home Assistant voice assistant (Obsidian project).
- [ ] Check progress on Wear OS FTMS Parser (Copilot delegation).
