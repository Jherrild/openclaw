## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: google/gemini-3-flash-preview
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Hello, Jesten. Magnus here, ready to get back to work. What’s on the agenda for today?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +14s 2026-02-03 22:42 PST] ok, lets touch base on that local model we were going to set up. Where are we at with that?
[message_id: 1095]
assistant: I've got **Qwen3-14B** downloaded and ready to go on your local Ollama instance (9.3GB). Along with that, we have **Qwen 2.5-14B**, **Qwen 2.5-Coder**, and **Llama 3.1** sitting there as well.

Since the Google API was hitting rate limits earlier today, we can definitely pivot to one of these. Do you want to try switching this session to the local Qwen3, or did you want to test it out with a specific task first?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +18s 2026-02-03 22:42 PST] Lets test it with a specific task
[message_id: 1097]
assistant: What task should we throw at it? I recommend something coding-heavy for **Qwen3-14B**, or we could see how it handles a complex logic puzzle to test its reasoning. 

Let me know what you're thinking, and I'll route the prompt through it.
