## Conversation Summary

assistant: The build passed! No output means no errors. We now have a Wear OS app that can scan for your Rogue Echo Rower.

### Next Steps:
1. **Manual Check:** You can now open this project in **Android Studio** on your Windows side (path: `C:\Users\Jherr\repos\ai.openclaw.rower`) and run it on your OnePlus Watch 3 to see if it detects the rower.
2. **Next Mission:** Shall I proceed to **Phase 3: FTMS Data Parsing** (reading the actual stroke data once connected)? 

Or do you want me to do a git commit for the BLE Scanning work first?

[message_id: 1088]
assistant: Done. I've safely tucked this away for when you're ready to resume:

1.  **Committed to Git:** All BLE scanning code is saved in the `main` branch of `~/repos/ai.openclaw.rower` (Commit: `8269d3f`).
2.  **Updated MEMORY.md:** I've noted that Phase 2 is complete and the build is verified, so I'll know exactly where to pick up (Phase 3: FTMS Data Parsing).
3.  **Project State:** The foundations (SDK, Gradle, Themes, Scanning) are solid and ready for the next "Ralph" loop.

I'm standing by whenever you're ready for the next project! [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +29s 2026-02-03 22:41 PST] I do not want the repository pushed to remote yet- is it local, or did you push it?
[message_id: 1090]
assistant: It is strictly **local**. I have not configured a remote (like GitHub) for this repository, and I will not push it anywhere without your explicit permission.

Everything is currently contained within `~/repos/ai.openclaw.rower` on your machine.
