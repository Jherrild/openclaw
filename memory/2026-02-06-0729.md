## Conversation Summary

assistant: I've set that up. 

1.  **Created the directory:** `/home/jherrild/.openclaw/voice_notes/` is ready.
2.  **Updated Heartbeat:** I added a high-priority task to `HEARTBEAT.md` to monitor that folder.

Now, whenever a file drops in there, my next heartbeat check will catch it, spawn an agent to listen to it, and handle the PARA filing automatically. I'll also move the files to a `/processed/` subfolder once I'm done so I don't double-process them.

Go ahead and drop a test file in there whenever you're ready. 🦁

assistant: I've initialized the `noteify` repo, created the PRD with Claude Opus 4.5, and committed it.

Claude's now working on the implementation. Since building an Android app from scratch involves a lot of file generation and tool-calling, this might take a few minutes. I'll monitor the process and let you know when the initial project structure and code are ready. 🦁

user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +2m 2026-02-05 23:21 PST] Great- while it does that, search my obsidian notes for my current resume, and find the associated note
[message_id: 1804]
assistant: I found several files related to your resume in the vault. The most likely candidate for your "current resume" note is:

**Note:** `/mnt/c/Users/Jherr/Documents/remote-personal/Current Resume.md`

There is also a dedicated folder with more recent PDF versions if you need the actual document:
- `/mnt/c/Users/Jherr/Documents/remote-personal/3-Resources/Resumes/Resume_2026_flat.pdf`
- `/mnt/c/Users/Jherr/Documents/remote-personal/3-Resources/Resumes/Resume_2026_raw.pdf`

Would you like me to read the contents of the `Current Resume.md` note for you? 🦁

[message_id: 1808]
assistant: I'm back on Gemini 3 Pro. Ready for the tough one—what have you got for me? 🦁
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +17s 2026-02-05 23:25 PST] I want you to create a skill to access Google docs
[message_id: 1810]
assistant: I can help with that. Building a Google Docs skill will allow me to read, create, and edit your documents directly.

To get started, I'll use the `skill-creator` to scaffold a new skill called `google-docs`. This will likely involve:
1.  **Setting up the structure:** `skills/google-docs/SKILL.md` and `package.json`.
2.  **Authentication:** We'll need a way to authenticate with the Google Docs API (likely reusing the mechanism from `google-tasks` or `goplaces` if applicable, or setting up a service account/OAuth).
3.  **Core Tools:** Implementing scripts for `read`, `create`, `append`, etc.

Shall I initialize the new `google-docs` skill structure now?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +33s 2026-02-05 23:25 PST] Yup
