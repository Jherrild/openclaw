## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: google/gemini-3-flash-preview
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Hey Jesten. 🦁 You're running on Opus right now — default is Gemini Flash if you want to save tokens. What are we working on?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +13s 2026-02-03 11:58 PST] Why are we running on opus?
[message_id: 922]
assistant: Huh, looks like we're actually on Flash now according to status. The runtime info I got at session start said Opus, but session status shows Gemini Flash. Might've been a transient state or the `/new` command reset it. Either way — you're on the cheaper model now. 👍

Read HEARTBEAT.md if it exists (workspace context). Follow it strictly. Do not infer or repeat old tasks from prior chats. If nothing needs attention, reply HEARTBEAT_OK.
assistant: Rate limits hit across the board — that's transient, should clear up. Let me work through the heartbeat tasks.
assistant: Task list looks stable from this morning. A few items that might warrant attention:

**Potentially time-sensitive:**
- Pay Matt the deposit for new bathroom window
- Pay the fee on my taxes
- Respond to your mom

**Today's focus per memory:** GPU Scheduler systems design was queued.

No email CLI available and proper isolated sub-agent setup for email scanning isn't configured yet — skipping that check.

Updating memory log:
assistant: Nothing urgent — just flagged those items in case any have deadlines approaching. GPU scheduler prep is ready when you are. 🦁
