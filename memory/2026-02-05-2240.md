## Conversation Summary

assistant: Done. `MEMORY.md` is updated.

**Do you want to proceed with the Global GPU Job Scheduler design now, or is there something else?**
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +20s 2026-02-05 14:27 PST] No, we're done with global GPU job scheduler design, we can stop working on that.
[message_id: 1703]
assistant: Got it. I've cleared the GPU Scheduler from the queue.

That leaves **Caching Strategies** or **Unique User Tracking** as the next potential topics on your list.

Or are you done with prep for now?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +16s 2026-02-05 14:28 PST] My interviews are over, and I'm done with prep
[message_id: 1705]
assistant: Congratulations on finishing the gauntlet! 🦁🎉

I've updated `MEMORY.md` to mark the Nvidia Prep project as **Completed**.

Do you want to shift focus back to the **WearOS Rower** (Phase 3: FTMS Parsing), or are you taking a well-deserved break?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +5m 2026-02-05 14:34 PST] The homesite claim letter document you made here is very broken. The frontmatter is incorrect, and the formatting of the document is terrible. Figure out why. Is it because you delegated it to gemini-flash? Is it because something in the script went wrong? '2-Areas/Home/Documents/2026-01-26 Homesite Claim Letter.md'
[message_id: 1707]
assistant: I found the issue. The file contained literal `\n` characters instead of actual newlines.

**Cause:** The `obsidian-scribe` script (`write.js`) was reading the command-line argument literally. When the agent (or sub-agent) passed text with escaped newlines (common in shell commands), the script wrote them as literal text (`\n`) rather than breaking the line. This broke the YAML frontmatter and the formatting.

**Fixes Applied:**
1.  **File Repaired:** I've rewritten `2026-01-26 Homesite Claim Letter.md` with correct formatting.
2.  **Tool Patched:** I updated `write.js` and `append.js` to automatically convert literal `\n` sequences into real newlines, so this won't happen again regardless of how the sub-agent formats the command.
user: Check: any blockers, opportunities, or progress updates needed?
assistant: **Heartbeat Check** (2026-02-05 14:48 PST)

*   **Progress:** I've completed the Nvidia Interview Prep and updated your memory. The Island County court order is filed and the payment tasks are set.
*   **Maintenance:** I've patched the `obsidian-scribe` tools (`write.js`/`append.js`) to prevent the newline formatting bug you caught in the Homesite Claim note.
*   **Opportunities:** Since your interviews are done, we could resume Phase 3 of the **WearOS Rower** (FTMS Parsing) if you're ready to jump back into code.

HEARTBEAT_OK
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +1m 2026-02-05 14:37 PST] What would you currently do if I sent you a zip file?
[message_id: 1710]
assistant: Right now, it would likely be a bit clumsy.

If you sent it without instructions (**Silent Document Trigger**):
1.  I would spawn a sub-agent.
2.  That agent would use standard Linux `unzip` to extract it to a temporary directory.
3.  **The problem:** My current instructions (`USER.md`) and tools (`obsidian-scribe`) are optimized for **single documents**.
    *   If the ZIP contains 20 receipts, the agent might try to create 20 separate notes (spamming you) or get stuck trying to "file" the directory structure.
    *   If it's a code project, it might try to put it in Obsidian (wrong place) instead of your `~/repos` directory.
    *   It might just give up and file the `.zip` file itself as a binary attachment in `2-Areas/.../Documents/`.

**Verdict:** I can handle it using standard Linux commands, but I lack a specific "Bulk Import" or "Project Unpack" protocol. I'd likely inspect it and then ask you where you want the explosion of files to go.
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +1m 2026-02-05 14:39 PST] Good to know- lets set an explicit directive that a zip file requires you to ask what I want done with the contents. You can call the unpack function, and inspect the file names/types, but don't delegate that work until you've asked me what I want done.
[message_id: 1712]
assistant: I've updated the **Silent Document Trigger** in `USER.md` with the new directive:

**Exception (ZIP Files):**
1.  **Unpack & Inspect:** I will list the contents immediately (Main Session).
2.  **Halt:** I will **not** auto-file or delegate.
3.  **Ask:** I will present the file list and ask for your command.

Ready for the next payload. 📦
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +29s 2026-02-05 14:40 PST] If I start a new session for you, are you going to reliably find that instruction in user.md?
[message_id: 1714]
assistant: Yes. `USER.md` is a special file.

It is **injected** directly into my context window at the start of *every* session (just like `MEMORY.md` and `AGENTS.md`). I don't have to "remember" to read it—it is part of my initial brain state before I even say "Hello."

So yes, that instruction is effectively hard-coded into me for all future sessions.
