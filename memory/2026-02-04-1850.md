assistant: The memory search result indicates a prior conversation where the branch state was confirmed as clean, with plans to review changes tomorrow and address the GPU Scheduler design problem. Since no explicit question was raised, I'll summarize the context and confirm the current status:

**Status Update**

- Tomorrow's agenda includes reviewing changes and tackling the **GPU Scheduler** design challenge.

assistant: The error indicates that a required parameter was missing in the request. To resolve this, ensure the `path` parameter is correctly provided in your function call. For example, if you're using the `gateway` function, verify that all required arguments are included. If the issue persists, provide more context or check the function's parameters. 

Let me know how you'd like to proceed!
