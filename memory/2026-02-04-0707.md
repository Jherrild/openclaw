## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: google/gemini-3-flash-preview
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Magnus here. I'm ready to dive back in—what's on the agenda for today?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +20s 2026-02-03 23:07 PST] I changed your primary model in the config to qwen3, and restarted the gateway. Why isn't it working?
[message_id: 1124]
assistant: I see the issue. You updated the **global default** (`agents.defaults.model.primary`), but my specific agent config for `main` still has a hardcoded override:

```json
{
  "id": "main",
  "model": "google/gemini-3-flash-preview"
}
```

Overrides in the `agents.list` take precedence over the defaults. I can fix this by removing that specific line so I inherit the global `qwen3` setting. 

Shall I go ahead and apply that change and restart the gateway?
