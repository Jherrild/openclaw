## Conversation Summary

user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Hey Jesten. 🦁 Running on Opus right now — your default is Gemini Flash if you want to switch back. What are we working on?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +10s 2026-02-03 15:18 PST] Please switch back
[message_id: 960]
assistant: Done — back on Gemini Flash. What's up?
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +28s 2026-02-03 15:19 PST] You're not actually back on Gemini- you've been rate limited. Please temporarily suspend all cron jobs.
[message_id: 962]
assistant: All 3 cron jobs suspended:
- Process Magnus Notes (every 10 min)
- Daily Memory Sync (midnight)
- Morning Briefing (7:15 AM)

Let me know when you want them back on.
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +31s 2026-02-03 15:19 PST] Great- remember that they've been suspended, so you don't forget between sessions
[message_id: 964]
