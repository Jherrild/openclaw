## Daily Notes
- 04:29 AM: Heartbeat triggered. Checked Google Tasks and cross-referenced with interview prep goals.

- 08:25 AM: Heartbeat triggered. Checked Google Tasks. New task detected: "measure the power opening on the RO filter". No emails checked (awaiting proper sub-agent capability).

- 09:20 AM: Heartbeat triggered. Checked Google Tasks. Task list is stable. Email check skipped (pending sub-agent isolation setup). No high-priority nudges required.

- 12:08 PM: Heartbeat triggered. Rate limit errors noted (transient). Task list stable. Flagged potential time-sensitive items: bathroom window deposit, tax fee, respond to mom. Email check skipped (no CLI/sub-agent configured).

## Ollama & Local Models
- **Status:** Verified `qwen3:14b` running locally via Ollama.
- **Performance:** ~11 tokens/sec with CPU/GPU split (33%/67%).
- **Config:** Added `qwen3` as a fallback model in `openclaw.json`. Tested and verified session override to `qwen3` works.
- **Usage:** Reserved for non-time-sensitive tasks and deep reasoning (logic puzzles).

## Systems Design Prep
- **Next Topic:** Global GPU Job Scheduler (Queued).
