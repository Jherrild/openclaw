assistant: Ready to roll, Jesten. What's on the agenda for today—more Nvidia prep, or something else entirely? 🦁
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +39s 2026-02-03 11:24 PST] Hey, I just manually set up a new agent profile 'mailman', I did it correctly this time so you wouldn't accidentally assume that profile

assistant: I see `mailman` in your config file (`/home/jherrild/.openclaw/openclaw.json`), so the setup looks correct on disk!

However, it's not showing up in my active agent list yet (`agents_list` only shows `main`). The gateway likely needs a restart to load the new agent profile.

Want me to restart the gateway now? (It'll take a few seconds and I'll ping you when I'm back.)
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +18s 2026-02-03 11:25 PST] Hmm, I already restarted the gateway. Any idea why it's not showing up?
