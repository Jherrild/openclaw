## Conversation Summary

user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +17s 2026-02-05 11:09 PST] What if I just ask you to save an image- would you know how to add it to my obsidian notes?
[message_id: 1540]
assistant: I can do that. If you send me an image and tell me where it belongs, I'll save the file to your workspace and update the corresponding Obsidian note with a link to it. [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +2m 2026-02-05 11:11 PST] I want you to create a rule for yourself- if I say "Save this for me" or "Remember this for me", you should save it in obsidian by default. If I've included an image, the image should also go with the note in obsidian. You should use the context of the message to decide where to create the note, how to name it, and what tags to add. If you're not certain, you should follow up and ask me to clarify the components you need clarified.
[message_id: 1542]
assistant: Acknowledged. I've updated my operating rules: "Save this for me" or "Remember this for me" will now trigger an automatic Obsidian save. I'll use the message context to determine the location, filename, and tags, and I'll make sure any accompanying images are linked and stored alongside the note.

If the context is too thin for me to make a solid call on where it belongs, I'll ask for clarification. [[reply_to_current]]
assistant: Acknowledged. I've updated my operating rules: "Save this for me" or "Remember this for me" will now trigger an automatic Obsidian save. I'll use the message context to determine the location, filename, and tags, and I'll include any attached images in the note. 

If I'm ever unsure about where it belongs or how to tag it, I'll ask for clarification before filing it away. [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +22s 2026-02-05 11:12 PST] Make sure to consider PARA when you're doing that.
[message_id: 1545]
assistant: Will do. I've updated your `USER.md` to explicitly include PARA (Projects, Areas, Resources, Archives) as the primary framework for those auto-saves. [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +30s 2026-02-05 11:13 PST] Do you understand the difference between a project, a resource, and an area?
[message_id: 1547]
assistant: Yes. Here is how I distinguish them:

*   **Projects (1-Projects):** Short-term efforts with a specific goal and a deadline (e.g., your WearOS Rower app or Nvidia interview prep).
*   **Areas (2-Areas):** Ongoing responsibilities that require a standard to be maintained over time (e.g., Finance, Health, or your "Distraction Graveyard").
*   **Resources (3-Resources):** Topics of ongoing interest or reference material without a specific goal or deadline (e.g., general coding snippets, gardening tips, or research on a specific technology).

I'll use that logic to decide where your notes land. [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +41s 2026-02-05 11:13 PST] When you save things to obsidian, do you use your new RAG search capabilities to look for an existing, relevant note first?
[message_id: 1549]
assistant: I will now. It's the most logical way to ensure I'm not creating duplicates and that I'm appending to the right context. Before creating a new note, I'll use `memory_search` to see if a relevant note already exists in your vault so I can update it instead. [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +1m 2026-02-05 11:15 PST] Great. If you DO find a relevant note for update, I want you to tell me, and ASK if I want it updated or in a new note before changing anything. If you don't find a relevant note, you can just make the new one. You should ALWAYS tell me when you make any changes to obsidian, and you should NEVER delete notes or content without my explicit permission first.
[message_id: 1551]
assistant: Understood. I've updated your `USER.md` with these specific safety and confirmation steps:

1.  **Search First**: I'll always check for existing notes using RAG before acting.
2.  **Ask on Match**: If I find a relevant note, I'll ask you whether to update it or start a new one.
3.  **Notify on New**: If I don't find a match, I'll create the note and let you know.
4.  **No Deletions**: I will never delete notes or existing content without your explicit green light.

I'm ready when you are. [[reply_to_current]]
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +1m 2026-02-05 11:16 PST] Great. When you add to a note, don't just append. Take a pass at considering where it would make sense to add content to the note, how it should be organized, and what format/header to use in the new section. Always consider asking me if you think the existing organization could be improved by proposing changes if you think they'd be beneficial.
[message_id: 1553]
assistant: Got it. I've updated my instructions to be more thoughtful about structure. I won't just dump text at the bottom; I'll look for the right section or create a logical new header. If I think the note is getting cluttered or could benefit from a reorganization, I'll propose a cleaner layout to you. [[reply_to_current]]
