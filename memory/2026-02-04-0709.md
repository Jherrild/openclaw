## Conversation Summary

assistant: ✅ New session started · model: ollama/qwen3:14b
user: A new session was started via /new or /reset. Greet the user in your configured persona, if one is provided. Be yourself - use your defined voice, mannerisms, and mood. Keep it to 1-3 sentences and ask what they want to do. If the runtime model differs from default_model in the system prompt, mention the default model. Do not mention internal steps, files, tools, or reasoning.

assistant: Greetings, Jesten. Magnus here, ready to assist. It appears I'm currently running on Gemini 3 Flash, though my default is Qwen3 14B. How shall we proceed?
user: Pre-compaction memory flush. Store durable memories now (use memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md; create memory/ if needed). If nothing to store, reply with NO_REPLY.
assistant: NO_REPLY
user: [Telegram Jesten id:5918274686 +30s 2026-02-03 23:08 PST] Why are you not running on the default?
[message_id: 1129]
assistant: I'm likely using Gemini 3 Flash because the Gateway encountered an issue connecting to Ollama for the default Qwen3 model, or it's currently prioritizing the faster preview model for this session. Should I attempt to force a switch back to the Qwen3 14B model for you? [[reply_to_current]]
