Updated `PRD-unofficial-api.md` to reflect reduced scope (removed 529-specific features, marked Phases 1-2 done). Created `monarch-bridge.mjs` CLI with three commands (`accounts`, `net-worth`, `transactions` with filter flags) and four supporting lib modules (`auth.mjs`, `format.mjs`, `accounts.mjs`, `transactions.mjs`). Updated `package.json` to replace the `check-529` script with `bridge`. All scripts parse and load correctly; auth guard and usage output verified. Live API test not possible from this host due to Cloudflare 525 (known issue, not a code bug).
