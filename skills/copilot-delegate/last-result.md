Researched and proposed a complete overhaul of the local-rag search system. Rewrote `skills/local-rag/PRD-refactor-hybrid-search.md` with a concrete plan to replace brute-force JS cosine similarity with `sqlite-vec` (native SIMD KNN), add SQLite FTS5 with BM25 for keyword search, and fuse results via Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF). Included PARA-aware indexing, paragraph-aware chunking, and detailed examples showing how queries like "tax documents" will correctly find the IRS letter via FTS5 tag/area matching.

**Succeeded:** Full PRD v2 written with 5-phase implementation plan, schema design, config changes, success metrics, and risk mitigations. No issues encountered.
