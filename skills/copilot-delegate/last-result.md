Implemented the area preference/priority system for the home-presence skill per PRD-feature-area-preference.md. Created `settings.json` with default preferred_areas (Office, Bedroom, Kitchen), refactored `followAndSpeak` in `presence.js` to pick the first preferred occupied room when multiple rooms are detected, added a `set-preference` CLI command to update the list, and documented everything in SKILL.md. All changes pass syntax validation; no issues encountered.
