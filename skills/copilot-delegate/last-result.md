Refactored `ha-bridge.js` to replace direct `openclaw system event` calls with a passive rolling JSONL log (`presence-log.jsonl`) capped at 5,000 lines with automatic trim-to-4,000 rotation. Added a `WAKE_ON_ENTITIES` high-priority set (currently empty) that preserves the plumbing to selectively re-enable agent-waking for specific entities without reverting to the old noisy model. Updated SKILL.md with full passive logging documentation, log format reference, and query examples, and updated the PRD with architecture rationale, implementation status, and design decisions.
