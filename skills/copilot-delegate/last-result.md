Implemented Phase 1 of the local-rag hybrid search overhaul. Added sqlite-vec for native SIMD vector search (vec_chunks + chunks tables), SQLite FTS5 with BM25 ranking (search_fts table with porter unicode61 tokenizer), paragraph-aware chunking (replacing character-based splitting), PARA metadata extraction from vault file paths (para_category, para_area), and Reciprocal Rank Fusion + entity shortcut functions in db.js. Updated config.json with new settings (rrf_k, fts_weights, embedding_dim, vector/fts limits). The old `documents` table and `getAllDocuments()`/`cmdSearch()` are preserved for backward compatibility during transition.

**Succeeded:** All new schema tables (vec_chunks, chunks, search_fts) create and query correctly. FTS5 BM25 search, sqlite-vec KNN search, RRF fusion, entity shortcut, and paragraph chunking all pass end-to-end tests. No issues encountered — sqlite-vec v0.1.7-alpha.2 loaded cleanly on this environment.
