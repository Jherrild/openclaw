Refactored `skills/monarch-bridge/monarch_bridge.py` to use the `monarchmoneycommunity` library (community fork). Removed all Cloudflare bypass patches, 1Password auto-login, and old commands (`account-details`, `categories`); replaced with clean implementation using `mm.interactive_login()` for auth and `mm.load_session()` for subsequent calls. Output format now matches the Node.js implementation (`name | $amount | type | institution` for accounts, pipe-delimited for transactions). Updated `requirements.txt` to depend on `monarchmoneycommunity` only.
