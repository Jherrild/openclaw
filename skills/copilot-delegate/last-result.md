Updated documentation across the workspace to reflect the Stages 1–3 supernote-sync overhaul. Updated `copilot-instructions.md` with new tool list and YAML mapping reference. Added document co-movement and mapping update docs to `obsidian-scribe/SKILL.md`. Marked `obsidian-scribe/prd/PRD-supernote-integration.md` and `supernote-sync/PRD.md` as superseded by `PRD-overhaul.md`. No issues.
