# Result: Document local-rag auto-indexing hooks in obsidian-scribe

Updated `skills/obsidian-scribe/SKILL.md` to document that local-rag is automatically triggered asynchronously after file operations (scribe_save, scribe_append, scribe_move, scribe_archive), added a new "Auto-Indexing" subsection under Workflows and a "Companion Tool: local-rag" cross-reference section above Tools. No issues encountered; all changes are documentation-only.
