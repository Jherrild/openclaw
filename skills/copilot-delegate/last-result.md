Created `para-predict.js` in `skills/local-rag/` — a PARA Predictor that takes document text as input, runs hybrid search (sqlite-vec KNN + FTS5 BM25 via Reciprocal Rank Fusion) against the indexed vault, analyzes the `para_category` and `para_area` metadata of the top-k neighbors, and outputs a predicted PARA destination path with a confidence score based on weighted vote consistency. Integrated the `predict` command into the main `rag.js` CLI entrypoint and exported `predictPara()` for programmatic use. All tests pass — verified end-to-end against the live vault with correct predictions and JSON output.
