Implemented Phase 2 dynamic watchlist: added GET `/rules/ha-entities` endpoint to `interrupt-service.js` that returns unique entity_ids from active `ha.state_change` rules, and refactored `ha-bridge.js` to replace the hardcoded `WAKE_ON_ENTITIES` set with a dynamic `WATCHLIST` that syncs from the interrupt-service every 5 minutes (with immediate sync on startup). SIGUSR2 signal triggers a manual sync. Both files pass syntax checks; no issues encountered.
