Researched the `monarch-money-api` npm package (v0.0.4) by reading its full source code on GitHub, the blog post at philbassham.com, and the existing monarch-bridge Python implementation. Updated `skills/monarch-bridge/PRD-unofficial-api.md` with a comprehensive technical plan covering 529 account retrieval (confirmed viable via `getAccounts()` type/subtype fields + `getAccountHoldings()` for fund-level detail), authentication flow, CLI architecture, API method reference, and comparison with the Docker approach. No issues encountered.
