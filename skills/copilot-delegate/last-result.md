Refactored `skills/task-orchestrator/orchestrator.js` and its timer template to improve systemd timer durability. Added `intervalToCalendar()` and `buildTimerDirectives()` functions: simple intervals that divide evenly into clock boundaries (e.g. 10m, 30m, 1h, 2h) now generate `OnCalendar` directives for wall-clock scheduling, while non-convertible intervals fall back to `OnUnitActiveSec` with an `OnActiveSec=1s` safety kickstarter to prevent stalls on timer restart. Updated the timer template to use a `{{TIMER_DIRECTIVES}}` placeholder rendered dynamically by `cmdAdd`. All changes pass syntax validation; no issues.
