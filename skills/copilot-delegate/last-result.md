Implemented Phase 1 of Local RAG Optimization: added incremental indexing via mtime tracking in the SQLite `file_metadata` table (with automatic schema migration), parallel batch embedding with configurable concurrency (default 5), and support for indexing specific files via CLI args (`node rag.js index <file>` or `node rag.js index <dir> file1 file2`). All changes across `db.js`, `embeddings.js`, `rag.js`, and `config.json` parse and load correctly. No issues encountered; Phase 2 (obsidian-scribe hooks) was intentionally skipped per instructions.
