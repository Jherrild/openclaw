## Session-Aware Interrupt Notifications

Added session-aware interrupt notifications to `copilot-lock.sh`. The wrapper now detects the current OpenClaw session ID (via `$OPENCLAW_SESSION_ID`, defaulting to `main`), accepts a `--notify-session <id>` flag to override the target session, and on task completion (success or failure) triggers an interrupt via the interrupt-service CLI. The notification includes status (Success/Failure) and a pointer to `last-result.md`. The interrupt fires in the existing `cleanup` trap, ensuring it runs regardless of exit path (normal, error, or signal). A `COPILOT_EXECUTED` guard prevents spurious notifications if the script exits before copilot runs (e.g., lock timeout).
