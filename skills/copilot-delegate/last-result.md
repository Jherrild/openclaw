Implemented Monarch Money Bridge Phase 1 prototype in `skills/monarch-bridge/`. Created `package.json` (with `monarch-money-api` dependency, installed successfully), `login.mjs` (interactive email/password/MFA login that prints the session token), and `check-529.mjs` (reads `MONARCH_TOKEN` from env, fetches accounts via `getAccounts()`, filters for 529 accounts by subtype/displayName, and fetches holdings via `getAccountHoldings()`). All scripts parse cleanly and the missing-token error path works correctly. No connectivity test was performed (requires a live token).
