Updated SKILL.md to document the Session-Aware Interrupt Notifications feature. Added a new subsection under Configuration explaining `--notify-session <id>`, default behavior via `$OPENCLAW_SESSION_ID`, and the sub-agent delegation use case. Updated Step 5 (Read the Result) and Important Rules (rule 7) to note that polling is no longer required thanks to automatic interrupt notifications.
