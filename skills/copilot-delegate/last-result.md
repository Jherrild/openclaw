Updated `skills/home-presence/presence.js` and `skills/home-presence/SKILL.md` (2026-02-08). Added Home Group speaker mapping (`media_player.home_group`) and priority-based routing to `follow-and-speak`. Routing rules: `--priority` flag → Home Group (all speakers); presence detected → occupied room speakers; no presence → Living Room fallback. CLI now accepts `follow-and-speak [--priority] <message>`. Syntax verified.
