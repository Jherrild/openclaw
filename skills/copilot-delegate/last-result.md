Refactored the copilot-delegate skill to auto-commit changes after successful tasks. Updated SKILL.md with auto-commit instructions embedded in all prompt templates (summary directive, good prompt example, OpenClaw-related task example), added a new "Post-Task Auto-Commit" section documenting the mechanism and conventional commit message format, and added a verification rule (#6) for Magnus. Updated prd/initial-design.md with the new feature status and design principle. No wrapper scripts were added — the auto-commit behavior is purely instruction-based, consistent with the skill's design philosophy.
