Implemented Stage 2 (Obsidian-Native Storage & Scribe Integration) of the supernote-sync overhaul. Rewrote `obsidian-scribe/lib/sync-mapping.js` to use the YAML-based mapping via `supernote-sync/mapping-utils.js` instead of the old JSON file, with support for both `localPath` and new `mdPath`/`pdfPath` fields. Updated `obsidian-scribe/move.js` to scan moved `.md` files for `![[documents/...]]` links and automatically move linked PDFs to the new location's `documents/` subfolder, cleaning up empty source directories. Added `findByPath()` helper to `mapping-utils.js` for cross-field path lookups. All files pass syntax validation; no issues.
