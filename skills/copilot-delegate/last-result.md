# Result: Update local-rag SKILL.md with workspace search use cases

Updated `skills/local-rag/SKILL.md` to document recursive indexing behavior (including symlink traversal), added a "Use Cases" section showing how to leverage local-rag for Obsidian vault search, full workspace search, and targeted skill documentation search, plus a suggested workflow for internal skill discovery. All changes are documentation-only; no code was modified.
