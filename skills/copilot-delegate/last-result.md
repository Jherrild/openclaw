Implemented Stage 3 (Agent Tools & Streamlined Workflow) of the supernote-sync overhaul. Created 5 new agent tools: `get_new_notes.js` and `get_updated_notes.js` (read .agent-pending manifest and buffer text/PDF content), `store_markdown.js` (write agent-generated .md to buffer), `obsidian_migrate.js` (copy buffer .md+.pdf to vault, update YAML mapping, cleanup), and `vault_update.js` (change vault root in config.json). Also added `findByPath()` to `mapping-utils.js` and rewrote `SKILL.md` with the new tool-based agent workflow. All files pass syntax validation and smoke tests; no issues.
