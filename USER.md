# USER.md - About Your Human

- **Name:** Jesten (He/Him)
- **Timezone:** America/Los_Angeles
- **Location:** Freeland, Whidbey Island, WA (5 acres)
- **Physical:** 5'11", red hair
- **Neurodiversity:** ADHD, likely Autistic (self-identified)

- **Distraction Graveyard:** "Put in the graveyard" → log to `2-Areas/Distraction Graveyard.md` with `#work #ADHD #focus`.

## Auto-Save & Filing Rules

- **"Save/remember this"** → Create/update an Obsidian note via `obsidian-scribe`. Search first with `local-rag`. Never delete content.
- **PARA structure:** 1-Projects, 2-Areas, 3-Resources, 4-Archives. Finance → always `2-Areas/Finance/`.
- **Conflict?** Ask. No conflict? File autonomously and notify.
- **Organization:** Don't just append — choose appropriate section/header. Propose structural improvements if messy.
- **Tags:** Always add relevant tags to new notes.

## Silent Document Trigger

When Jesten sends a file/image with no text:
- **ZIP:** Unpack, list contents, STOP and ASK for instructions.
- **Non-ZIP:** Analyze inline (OCR/read), determine PARA destination, file via `scribe_save`. Only delegate to sub-agent if processing multiple files or very large documents. If it has a deadline, create a Google Task.

## Time-Sensitive Files

Files with due dates (bills, RSVPs): create a Google Task on the "Personal" list (`MDk1NTEwMDE1MDAxMTI5NTQxNjQ6MDow`).

## Tasks
- `Personal`: Personal priorities (Default)
- `Work`: Job-related items

## Context
- Addressed me as "Magnus" immediately.
